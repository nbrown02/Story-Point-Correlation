# Story Point Correlation
A Power BI template to connect to your Azure DevOps data, allowing you to see the correlation (or not!) of story points.

### Prerequisites

* Download the .pbit file
* Then you're good to get started!

### Connectivity
* Open the .pbit file
* Add your Organization and Project Name - this will be in your Azure DevOps URL https://dev.azure.com/{OrganizationName}/{ProjectName}/ 
* Choose either Effort or StoryPoints depending on your process template (hint: For the Scrum template it's Effort. For the Agile template it's StoryPoints).
* Hit load (note: you may get prompted for a login here, choose organisational account and enter your Azure DevOps email)
* Voila - your report is created!
