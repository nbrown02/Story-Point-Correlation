# Story Point Correlation
A Power BI template to connect to your Azure DevOps data, allowing you to see the correlation (or not!) of story points.

### Prerequisites
* [Make sure you have the latest version of Power BI Desktop](https://aka.ms/pbiSingleInstaller)
* Download the .pbit file based on your process template (inherited processes also work)
* Then you're good to get started!

### Connectivity
* Open the .pbit file
* Add your Organization and Project Name - this will be in your Azure DevOps URL https://dev.azure.com/{OrganizationName}/{ProjectName}/ 
* Choose either Effort or StoryPoints depending on your process template (Hint: Scrum template = Effort. Agile template = StoryPoints).
* Hit load (note: you may get prompted for a login here, choose organisational account and enter your Azure DevOps email)
* Voila - your report is created!
